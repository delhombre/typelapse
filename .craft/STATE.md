# Running state (orchestrator)

Kept current by the orchestrator so that compaction or a new session loses nothing. One line per item; prune when done.

## Current goal
Third gate pass on main (2825aff): SHIP WITH NITS. #200, #201, #206 merged; #208 (nits of #203) in review. Next: merge #208, decide #174/#179/#182/#204/#205/#207/#209, then the next feature wave. Owner items unchanged (#65, #70, #71, #77, #79, #112).

## Plan (checkbox per verifiable unit)
- [x] #154 wave, #156 usage ledger, #158 phone pass two, #161 Polar billing, #162 migrate once, #163 opaque sheet, #164 citations: merged
- [x] #165 chore, #175 corrections (#173) merged 2026-10-06 night
- [x] #176 phone (#169), #177 export (#166, #170), #178 landing (#171, #172), #180 studio (#167, #168) merged 2026-10-06 night
- [x] Second gate pass run (Docker up): D1 to D8 of the first pass hold, D4 partial
- [x] #185 (#193, Opus rebuild after review), #186 (#191), #187 (#195), #188 (#194), #189 (#192), #183 (#184) merged 2026-10-06/07 night
- [x] #197 (#200), #198 (#201), #202 (#206) merged 2026-10-07
- [ ] #203 (#208): rework on item 6, re-review, merge
- [ ] Decide #174, #179, #182, #204, #205, #207, #209
- [ ] Owner: production Polar organisation, webhook endpoint, live token; staging (#70); then #71; Docker up before the next gate

## Decisions (date, decision, why)
- Every product decision lives in `docs/decisions/` (D-numbers, Pivot lines); this file only points there. Latest: `2026-10-05-next-wave.md` D1 to D12.
- 2026-10-06 night, second pass: `2026-10-06-gate-second-pass.md` D1 to D5 (no unbounded loop and a boot guard; one-line title; phone panels under the frame; display cells; nits).
- 2026-10-06, craft-harness enabled: `.craft/verify.sh` is the gate a builder must pass; tester.army e2e on Gemini Flash through the shell's key, replay without a model.

## In flight (agent, files owned, status)
- #203 builder (PR #208: monaco-language, line-ranges holdableFocus, hosted-project-sync, render.ts ticks, preview-island fade, step-caption + frame-metrics caption band)

## Open findings from /craft-harness:verify
- 2026-10-06 first pass: DO NOT SHIP, #166 to #174, all fixed but #174. Second pass (evidence 2026-10-06-main-2): DO NOT SHIP, #185 to #189; #179 #182 #183 opened along the way; second pass fixed through #191 to #196; follow-ups #197 #198. Third pass (evidence 2026-10-07-main-3): SHIP WITH NITS, #202 #203 #204 opened, #205 #207 #209 from reviews
